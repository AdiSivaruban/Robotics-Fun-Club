    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>Welcome to Our STEM Adventure!</h2>
      <p>
        The Robotics Fun Club is a community workshop and website for younger kids to explore basic robotics and science concepts using simple, everyday materials like batteries, paperclips, foil, cardboard, and rubber bands. Our activities help kids get excited about robotics and learning without screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by a passionate educator with experience teaching piano and helping run summer camps, our club brings together the joy of hands-on learning with the excitement of robotics. We've discovered that the best way to learn about science and technology is through getting your hands dirty and building real things!
      </p>
      <h2>üéØ Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We're on a mission to make robotics and STEM education accessible to every child in our local community, regardless of their background or resources. Using simple materials you already have at home, we show kids they don't need expensive kits to explore the wonders of science and engineering.
      </p>
