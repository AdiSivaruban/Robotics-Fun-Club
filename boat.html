    <h2>🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <div class="step">
      <span>Step 1: Prepare the Bottle Hull</span>
      Use the plastic bottle as the boat body. Make sure it floats and is sealed tightly. Decorate it to make it uniquely yours!
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span>Step 2: Make the Paddle Axle</span>
      Tape or glue two popsicle sticks parallel to each other on the sides near the back of the bottle. Leave a gap between them for your paddle to spin.
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span>Step 3: Attach the Rubber Band</span>
      Stretch the rubber band between the two popsicle sticks so it hangs across the gap. Make sure it’s snug but not too tight.
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span>Step 4: Make and Insert the Paddle</span>
      Cut one popsicle stick in half. Insert it through the middle of the rubber band and tape it in place. This will act as your boat's paddle.
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span>Step 5: Wind It Up and Launch</span>
      Twist the paddle backward to wind up the rubber band. Gently place the boat in water and release — your paddle will spin and push the boat forward!
