    <h2>🧰 Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 empty plastic water bottle (with cap)</li>
      <li>3 popsicle sticks</li>
      <li>1 strong rubber band</li>
      <li>Tape</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <div class="step">
      <p><span class="highlight">Step 1: Prepare the Bottle Hull</span><br>
      Use the plastic bottle as the boat body. Make sure it floats and is sealed tightly. Decorate it to make it uniquely yours!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <p><span class="highlight">Step 2: Make the Paddle Axle</span><br>
      Tape or glue two popsicle sticks parallel to each other on the sides near the back of the bottle. Leave a gap between them for your paddle to spin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <p><span class="highlight">Step 3: Attach the Rubber Band</span><br>
      Stretch the rubber band between the two popsicle sticks so it hangs across the gap. Make sure it’s snug but not too tight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <p><span class="highlight">Step 4: Make and Insert the Paddle</span><br>
      Cut one popsicle stick in half. Insert it through the middle of the rubber band and tape it in place. This will act as your boat's paddle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <p><span class="highlight">Step 5: Wind It Up and Launch</span><br>
      Twist the paddle backward to wind up the rubber band. Gently place the boat in water and release — your paddle will spin and push the boat forward!</p>
