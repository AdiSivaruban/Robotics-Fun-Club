                    What made this event truly special was seeing how our local community embraced the opportunity to connect. Parents collaborated on building catapults with their children, sharing tips and celebrating each other's successes. During the nature hike, families who had just met were walking together, with children excitedly pointing out discoveries to their new friends.
