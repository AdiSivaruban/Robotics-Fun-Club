        <h3><a href="boat.html">Project 1: Paddle Boat</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 empty plastic water bottle (with cap)</li>
          <li>3 popsicle sticks</li>
          <li>1 strong rubber band</li>
          <li>Tape</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Bottle Hull</strong><br>
        Use the plastic bottle as the body (hull) of your boat. Make sure it’s sealed tightly and floats. You can decorate it however you want at this point!</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Make the Paddle Axle</strong><br>
        Tape or glue two popsicle sticks parallel to each other on the sides near the back of the bottle. These will act as the supports for your rubber band paddle system. Make sure there’s a small gap between the sticks for the paddle to spin freely.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Attach the Rubber Band</strong><br>
        Stretch the rubber band between the two popsicle sticks (wrap it around both ends). Make sure it’s tight but not about to snap.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Make and Attach the Paddle</strong><br>
        Take a popsicle stick and cut it in half. Slide the popsicle stick into the middle of the rubber band, and tape it together.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Wind It Up and Launch</strong><br>
        Wind the paddle by spinning it backward, twisting the rubber band tightly. Place the boat gently in water and let go! The rubber band will unwind, spinning the paddle and pushing your boat forward.</p>
