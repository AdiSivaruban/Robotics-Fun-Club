                    <ul>
                        <li>1 empty plastic water bottle (with cap)</li>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Bottle Hull</strong><br>
                    Use the plastic bottle as the body (hull) of your boat. Make sure it's sealed tightly and floats. You can decorate it however you want at this point!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Make the Paddle Axle</strong><br>
                    Tape or glue two popsicle sticks parallel to each other on the sides near the back of the bottle. These will act as the supports for your rubber band paddle system. Make sure there's a small gap between the sticks for the paddle to spin freely.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 3: Attach the Rubber Band</strong><br>
                    Stretch the rubber band between the two popsicle sticks (wrap it around both ends). Make sure it's tight but not about to snap.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 4: Make and Attach the Paddle</strong><br>
                    Take a popsicle stick and cut it in half. Slide the popsicle stick into the middle of the rubber band, and tape it together.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 5: Wind It Up and Launch</strong><br>
                    Wind the paddle by spinning it backward, twisting the rubber band tightly. Place the boat gently in water and let go! The rubber band will unwind, spinning the paddle and pushing your boat forward.</p>

                <p>Create a mechanical grabber that works like a real robot arm!</p>
                <div class="materials-list">
                    <h4>Materials Needed:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 wooden ruler</li>
                        <li>Cardboard strips</li>

                </div>
                <div class="project-instructions">
                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Cardboard Pieces</strong><br>
                    Cut three long cardboard strips (they will act as the "arms" of the grabber). Cut two shorter cardboard strips will act as the "linkers" between the arms and the handle. Punch a small hole near each end of the cardboard strips so they can be connected with paper fasteners later.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Build the Scissor Mechanism</strong><br>
                    Cross the two long cardboard arms into an "X" shape. Use one paper fastener to pin them together at the center where they cross, this is the pivot point. Now the arms should move like scissors when you pull the ends.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 3: Attach the Pieces</strong><br>
                    Take 2 of the short strips and attach one end of each to the bottom end of each long strip using paper fasteners. Fold over your third long cardboard strip over the ruler and tape it together to secure. Take the 2 short strips and attach it to the top of the cardboard strip on the ruler with the same paper fastener.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 4: Attach the joints</strong><br>
                    Hook one end of a rubber band around the paper fastener where the two long arms cross. Stretch it and hook the other end around the paper fastener holding the short strips to the base (near the ruler). This makes your grabber automatically spring close when not being pulled.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 5: Add the String</strong><br>
                    Cut a long piece of string. Tie one end of the string to the rubberband. When you pull the string, the rubberbands will pull the arms open. When you let go, the tension in the bands will snap them back!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 6: Customize Your Grabbing Tips</strong><br>
                    Optional: Tape small pieces of sponge, bottle caps, or rubber bands to the grabbing ends of the arms for better grip and control. You can even draw eyes or decorate it to look like a robot claw!</p>

                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Rocket Body</strong><br>
                    Use the empty plastic bottle as your rocket body. Make sure it's clean and dry. Puncture a hole inside the lid of your bottle cap to allow pressure to escape. You can decorate this bottle however you like!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Build the Pencil Tripod Base</strong><br>
                    Making sure the bottle is facing downwards, attach three pencils around the bottle to form a tripod like base.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 3: Add Fuel (Hairspray / Deodorant)</strong><br>
                    Spray a short burst of hairspray (about half a second) inside the bottle and fasten the lid. Give the bottle a shake for 5-10 seconds while plugging the hole with your finger.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 4: Ignite the Rocket</strong><br>
                    Hold the BBQ lighter flame near the bottle opening (but <strong>do not touch</strong> the flame to the bottle). The hairspray vapor inside will ignite and rapidly expand, creating pressure. The bottle will launch upwards, propelled by the expanding gases.</p>

                <div class="project-instructions">
                    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Wheels</strong><br>
                    Push a skewer through two bottle caps to make one axle with two wheels. Repeat for the second skewer and two bottle caps. Make sure the wheels spin freely on the skewers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Attach the Axles to the Bottle</strong><br>
                    Poke 4 holes through the bottle. Place the two axles through the bottle so the wheels stick out on each side. Use tape to securely attach the skewers to the bottle, making sure the wheels can still spin.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 3: Prepare the Balloon Nozzle</strong><br>
                    Insert the straw into the opening of the balloon, pushing it in enough to hold tight but not block airflow. Tape the balloon to the straw to keep it in place.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 4: Attach the Balloon to the Car</strong><br>
                    Tape the straw (with the balloon attached) to the top or side of the bottle, positioning the straw so the open end points backwards. This will direct the air behind the car.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 5: Inflate and Launch!</strong><br>
                    Inflate the balloon by blowing air through the straw and pinch the straw so air doesn't escape. Place the car on a flat surface with wheels lined up straight. Release the straw and watch your car zoom forward powered by the escaping air!</p>
